## Tasks for Today
- [ ] finalize code review for frontend merge
- [ ] work on issue #37 for additional frontend features

## Summary of Progress
- merged #32 into main after code review
- started on a new branch for #37 to implement additional frontend features
- Separate issues emerged from #37 regarding backend optimizations; created new issues to track these tasks (#50-52) 

## To Do/Implement (Discussed with Bernt)
- log field 
- [x]deduplicate -> unique variants
- phenopackets rename as reports
- nr of individuals with xyz reports
- diseases aka diagnose remove -> primary disease problem 
- check for OMIM to add to phenotypes
- check where MONDO linking is coming from? maybe OMIM better?
- maybe categories based on HPO terms?
- Pagination: already implemented but no sorting or filtering
- [x] JSON API standard for all table endpoints
    - with search functionality -> w/ search field to search for variant type for example
- work with modules to reuse
- add type to publication and also medical_speciality from google sheets 
- bias if speciality reporting the patient

- first priority that all phenotpes are there plus the variants
- Variants 
- published identifier for individual identifier  
- add more test cases for frontend 1st author plus name of individual from publication
- Objekt mit phenotypen und dann nach phenotypen filtern/suchen (SysNDD) plus stats 
- response mit Metaobjekten 
- variant labels weird -> check why in phenopacket report
- FLAG dazugeben inferred, reported
- startpage already visualisation under search field for variant location
    - SNV and additional large CNVs
    - Also shown filtered variants for individual variant and patient
- Aggregations
- - double check numbers to see if there is an import mistake
- Age of onset add not reported option
- check how many variants are there per report
- check how many phenotypes per reportcheck logic
- double check fetus reports (might not be part of the analysis)
- maybe do fetus vs born
- phenotypes stacked bar 
- make control for dedulicated or all for Variants donut chart
 - unique vs all has to be clear
 - add unique toggle 
- Phenotypic Feature not as donut chart but as bar chart (stacked)
 - maybe with each phenotype show nr reported (yes, no) & not reported
- Check login feature 
- typecheck, linting fehler, testing before merging 
- make CI test command before commits
- Add Favicon with project logo and proper name

## Tasks for Today
- [] finish issues from frontend-phenopackets-v2-migration
    -[x] #39
    -[x] #49
    -[x] #62
    -[x] #41

## To Do (Discussed with Bernt)
- new functionality of users once logged in
- add users from reviewers section of google sheets as login users (info from user_name to orcid column in google sheets)
    - have their contributions linked (i.e which phenopackets they reviewed)
- view in frontend to add phenopackets from logged in users
- able to delete as admin
- reviewer only add phenopacket to existing patient -> integrate info to existing phenopacket and have it shown as a timeline or add new patient
- add in backend measure to check if entry is valid (i.e. 398A>G valid but 398X>G not valid) (ensemble?) 
- zoom function does not work
- protein view first for detailed variant view instead of gene view
- ensure that lollipop style is the same across all views (& extends fully down)
- replace exon boxes in region view with chromosome? (p & q arms) of Chr 17 with region of CNVs high
- allow filtering (i.e. clicking on legend items filters the variants shown)
- In Network -> Response -> label there is a duplication (i.e. (p.Met160Ter) (p.Met160Ter))
- fix any other UI inconsistencies
- main focus is to finish issues #39, #49, #62 and #41
- fix pagination, filtering
- rename phenopackets to individual 1, individual 2 etc.
- double check domain positions from HNF1B
    - "Download the human HNF1B protein sequence (RefSeq NP_000449.1 / UniProt P35680).
        Extract four segments: residues 1–31 (dimerisation), 8–173 (POU-specific region), 232–305 (homeodomain / DNA-binding core), 314–557 (transactivation region).
        Draw a horizontal bar representing residues 1-557, colour-code the four segments distinctly, label each domain with start-stop and name.
        Additionally, load the PDB structure 2H8R and render a ribbon diagram of residues 232-305, then place the ribbon as an inset next to the full bar.
        Annotate sources: UniProt “Domains & Repeats” section for P35680; CDD cd00086 for homeodomain; Pfam HNF-1B_C for C-terminal region.
        Output high-resolution figure (PDF or PNG) with legend and domain coordinate list."
